Permission was obtained from Stephen Hsu to include these files in this repository.
Both of these files were modified by Christopher Khan in 2020. The modification to 
scmap.m was that the speed of sound in m/s was added as an input to the scmap function. 
The modification to sconvert.m was that the speed of sound in m/s was added as an input
to the scan_convert function and as an input in the scmap function call.

The code for the ica.m function was obtained from the paper "A Tutorial on Independent Component Analysis" by Jonathon Shlens.
